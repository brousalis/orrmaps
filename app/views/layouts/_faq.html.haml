              .answer 
                When you hit 80, most of the end game exotics as well as legendary require 
                %strong Orichalcum ore
                and
                %strong Ancient Wood.
                These materials can be gathered in the Machlor's Leap, Cursed Shore, and Frostgorge Sound. They can also be found in WvW, but I have not finished this feature yet. The locations of these materials change every week and are different by server.

              %a{:href => "#"} How do I make my own map?
              .answer Just sign in! If you are not registered, it will automatically make an account for you with a new map. Once you log in, you'll see an empty map where you can add markers to it by selecting a marker from the toolbox at the top right and clicking on the map.
            %li
              %a{:href => "#"} How does the Server map work?
              .answer 
                Each map on a server keeps track of
                %strong likes.
                The points on the maps with the most likes will be more visible than the other maps on the server map. To like a map, visit it's individual page and click on the thumbs up icon.
